# Lung Cancer Detection and Classification

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women and afflicts 225,500 people a year in the
United States. Nearly 1 out of 4 cancer deaths are from lung cancer, more than colon, breast, and prostate cancers
combined. Early detection of the cancer can allow for early treatment which significantly increases the chances
of survival.
Lung cancer screening is performed with a CT scan that collects hundreds of images to build a full 3D composite of
the lung. Next, small growths called pulmonary nodules need to be detected. These nodules show up as small,
circular structures on the CT scans.
