# Lung-Cancer-detection-and-classification
This model aims to detect if a patient is suffering from Lung cancer and then diagnose the kind of lung cancer.

Currently we are able to achieve an overall 87% accuracy by using ResNet50 and DenseNet201.

The scope of this project aims to use New Neural network models like Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) and Spiking Neural Networks.
