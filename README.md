# Lung-Cancer-detection-and-classification
This model aims to detect if a patient is suffering from Lung cancer and then diagnose the kind of lung cancer.

Currently we are able to achieve an overall 87% accuracy by using ResNet50 and DenseNet201.

The scope of this project aims to use New Neural network models like Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) and Spiking Neural Networks for potentially higher efficiency and accuracy.
